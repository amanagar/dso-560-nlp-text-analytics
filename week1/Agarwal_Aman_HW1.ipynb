    "* Identified 4 major themes from the reviews (2pts)\n",
    "* Regex that groups / cleans the reviews is correctly implemented (4pts)\n",

    "* *The store managers should consider trying to improve the drive through experience to be more pleasant for customers*\n",
    "* *Drive throughs are mentioned 23% of the time in reviews, and often focus on how slow the service is. We recommend adopting parallel drive through stations for Atlanta and Chicago*\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Identify 4 recurring themes/topics that reviewers are unhappy with. For example, one theme is that users are consistently unhappy with the drive-through experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, using regex, group together all occurrences of these phrases. For example, `drive-thru`, `drive through`, `drivethrough` can all be replaced as `_DRIVE_THROUGH_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform a word count, both overall, and broken out by city.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide a few sentences with your findings and business recommendations.** Make any assumptions you'd like. I just want you to get into the habit of \"finishing\" your analysis: to avoid delivering technical numbers to a non-technical manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations in your analysis:\n",

    "### Business Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer service seems to be a a constant problem across all McDonalds Locations. McDonalds needs to ensure that customer satisication is being looked into with a concentrated effort to address slowness and correctness in terms of order fulfillment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In Several locations like Las Vegas, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles the number of instances of staff being rude and unfriendly have been large which should be looked into and necessary steps like reorganization and adequate training should be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overall Hygiene should be paramount and McDonalds should look to maintain a zero tolerant policy in terms of cleanliness and ensure that all surroundings are fresh, sanitized and clean at all times for a good customer experience\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quality of Food should at all times top notch with the brand value at stake. McDonalds should stand for fast food which is the freshest and tastiest. Steps should be taken to ensure all fresh items are being used to fulfill the orders at all time. Microwaving of old items should not be acceptable, serving cold food should mean stern action against the perpetrtor in teh respective store.\n",

    "##### Pitfalls/Limitations to be addressed\n",
    "\n",
    "a) The word count analysis is not useful at all times since it is very difficult to sometime understand the context of the sentence. A word like 'slow' might be used in multiple contexts and might not always be talking about customer service. This issue cannot be addressed by a word count analysis and might potentially skew the real picture for us\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The word count pertaining a review might not necessarily bring out the real sentiment of the review and will no thus be a good indicator of the real situation\n",
    "\n",
    "c) For the word count be more effective we need to make a more 'capturing group', a regex expression might not capture all the relevant bits and pieces of information in our dataset"
